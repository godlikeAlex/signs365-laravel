                How and when do we share information?
              </p>

              <p>
                Signs7 shares your information with select third parties,
                companies or individuals that we employ to process information
                on our behalf based on our specific instructions and in
                compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, Easy Way
                Install shares payment card (credit/debit) information with the
                payment companies we use to store your payment information. We
                also share data with our email provider, the company that holds
                our customer account information. Some information we acquire
                may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. Each of
                these providers is responsible to maintain and uphold their own
                privacy policy. Signs7 reserves the right to access, read,
                preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe
                is necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal
                process or governmental or legal request, enforce this Privacy
                Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of
                potential violations hereof, detect, prevent, or otherwise
                address fraud, security or technical issues, or protect our
                rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This
                includes exchanging information with other companies and
                organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.
              </p>

              <p>
                Signs7 shares information if we believe that disclosure is
                reasonably necessary to protect the safety, rights, or property
                of the public. We may also share with our wholly owned
                subsidiaries and affiliates. If Signs7 we were to engage in a
                merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, re-organization,
                or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer
                of the information described in this Policy, Signs7 would share
                your information with a party involved in such a process (for
                example, a potential purchaser).
              </p>

              <p>
                DISCLAIMER: WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
                LEAVE Signs7 OR ANY Signs7 OWNED SITE.

                Signs7 keeps your information only for a period of time that we
                need said information for the reason of protecting your account
                information and to access information about your purchased
                products and to fulfill the purposes described herein this
